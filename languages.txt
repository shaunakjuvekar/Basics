- What is your favorite programming language? Why?
-> My favorite language is Python mainly because of it’s ease of use. It may not be the fastest language but it is flexible enough to be able to work in multiple scenarios.

- Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?
-> I’m probably more experienced with Javascript but due to things like weak typing, I prefer Python over it.
